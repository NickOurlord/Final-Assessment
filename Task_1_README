The instructions to run the Task 1 program are detailed below

Open the file named 'the name' with a Python lDE such as PyCharm or Visual Studio code.

The 4 graphs are printed out by typing their corresponding flag names in the terminal of the lDE.

In the terminal, type “python3 FCP_assignment_Task_1.py -" followed by the flag name at the end.

For example, “python3 FCP_assignment_Task_1.py -ising_model”
The names of the 4 flags are:
	-ising_model
	-ising_model -external -0.1
	-ising_model -alpha 10
	-test_ising


Note that the value followed by external and alpha are variable. The code should default to using a value of H = 0 and a value of alpha = 1, unless you also include the flag -external -<H> and -alpha <alpha>.

Each graph is going to be opened in separate windows.
"python3 FCP_assignment_Task_1.py -ising_model", “python3 FCP_assignment_Task_1.py -ising_model -external -0.1", “python3 FCP_assignment_Task_1.py -ising_model -alpha 10”, and “python3 FCP_assignment_Task_1.py -test_ising”.
